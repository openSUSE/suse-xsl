- General:
  - Use consistent question label in `qandaentry`s (bsc#1162324)
  - Update architecture names to current nomenclature
  - Disable intra-xrefs if we point to another book AND we have an

    template but remove the link (#398)

- HTML:
  - Allow copying content of screens to the clipboard
  - Support for issue templates in report-bug links

    "mailto:" link instead of e-mail form on suse.com
  - Fix issues where we got duplicate section/chapter IDs in HTML
    output (#269)
  - Add permalinks to more output elements (such as chapters)
  - Add og:... tags to HTML pages, for improved social sharing
  - Allow including external JS with new parameters external.js (always
    include) and external.js.onlineonly (only include when on
    non-"file:" URL)
  - Stop relying on negative margins in CSS that were causing overlaid
    elements and other ugly experience issue
  - Fix closing behavior of mobile menu
  - Minor CSS improvements
  - Update SUSE footer link URLs

  - Stop adding "Abstract" titles over abstracts
