#
#   novdocx.dtd is a subset of DocBook and all instances should be valid
#   DocBook files, however, the docbookx.dtd is not directly referenced.
#
#   Use this file with Emacs and nXML or any other XML editor which
#   supports RELAX NG.
#
#  ** This file just definies the start pattern, but not the core
#     elements for Novdoc. The core elements are definied in the
#     novdoc-core.rnc file which is converted from the DTD during
#     installation. 
#     It can be manually created by running trang with the 
#      -i no-generate-start option:
#     $ trang -i no-generate-start novdocx.dtd novdocx-core.rnc
