This project contains customization layers for the DocBook XSL stylesheets.


Requirements for Building
-------------------------

These stylesheets can be used as-is for DocBook 4 content.
To use them with DocBook 5 content, build them with `make`.
For a successful build, you will need:

* standard GNU utilities (`cat`, `sed`, `tar`, ...)
* `trang`
* `xsltproc`
* `xmlcatalog`
* `aspell`

Requirements for Use
--------------------

* DAPS from https://github.com/openSUSE/daps
* DocBook XSL stylesheets from https://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/
* XSLT processor like `xsltproc` or Saxon 6 (needs to have support for exslt)
* Python 3

Requirements for Testing
------------------------

* `dapscompare` from Documentation:Tools

Running the Tests
-----------------

The current tests are not run automatically and need some manual intervention
for use. They are based upon creating reference images of test documents,
making a code change and then creating updated images of the test documents.
Then, you can compare the updated images to the reference images.

On the command line, this works out to the following:

1. In the first invocation, run `./run_dapscompare.sh reference` (from the
   `tests/` directory). This will create reference images, that is the baseline
   from which you can judge if what you did was correct or not).
2. Do the stylesheet changes.
3. Now run `./run_dapscompare.sh` (without any arguments) again. This will
   create the comparison images. If there are changes between reference and
   comparison images, those will be shown to you in a GUI.

The reference images are currently not stored centrally: They differ
somewhat depending on, for example, font rendering settings between different
computers.
